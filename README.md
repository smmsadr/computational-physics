# Computational Physics

This repository is a set of computational physics codes and exercises, I originally did in fortran back 2005. I am rewriting these codes to python. The aim is to make this repository to an educational resource.
I will be glad for any contribution and comment.

* Some of the sub projects here can become their own project and repository.
