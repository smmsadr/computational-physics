# Computational Physics

This repository is a set of computational physics codes and exercises, I originally did in fortran back 2005. I am re-writing these codes to python classes as they can be reused by me as well as others and also can be a refreshment for my old practices and work. I will keep this code free source, so all students and lecturers can use my code as sample for their own classes or practices. This is a free source project, so please feel free to fork, change and contribute.

* Some of the sub projects here can become their own project and repository.
